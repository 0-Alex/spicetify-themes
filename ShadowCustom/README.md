Shadow Custom Theme:

This theme removes the friends section allowing more space for the playlist your viewing or the tab you are on.
The bottom bar is increased in size, allowing for a larger 'Now Playing' Image cover.
The now playing bar has been increased in size, easier to scrub through the song and the elapsed time shown each side.
Volume rocker increased in size, easier to control.
Feel free to comment suggestions or bugs and ill try and improve/fix.
